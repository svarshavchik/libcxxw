      &appshort; is an optional add-on library to &libcxx;
      that implements a basic X user interface toolkit with a modern
      C++17 <acronym>API</acronym> and without any dependencies on large
      Gnome (GTK) or QT libraries. The only dependencies are
      toolkit-independent
      libraries that are not tied to any particular desktop environment.
      See <xref linkend="INSTALL" /> for more information.
      &appshort; aims to make it possible to quickly implement a simple,
      basic, no-frills X user interface in C++.
      Notable features:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Uses modern C++17 language features, such as:
	  lambdas for handling events like mouse button clicks and other
	  user activity; variant parameter types for providing a compact
	  API selecting alternative options;
	  all display elements are reference-counted objects; and
	  other C++17 features.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Implements basic, themeable UI elements: labels, text input fields,
	  lists, combo boxes, menus, and dialogs. The default theme uses
	  subtle gradients to implement a light 3D effect.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The default UI elements are scalable, using a
	  <link linkend="sxg">library-specific
	    scalable graphic format</link>. Alternatively, an application
	  may load its own <acronym>GIF</acronym>, <acronym>PNG</acronym>,
	  or <acronym>JPG</acronym> fixed-size images.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  All display elements have full keyboard navigation, where
	  possible. Even scrollbars have keyboard-based navigation.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Unlike other high-level toolkits,
	  &app; does not require the application to use an event-driven
	  design. &app; run an internal execution thread that handles all
	  X events. The main application
	  thread can be working on a dedicated, long-running task that
	  blocks all pointer and keyboard events, but the background thread
	  continues to update the display elements, and process X events
	  as needed, all by itself.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  &app; is a compositing toolkit. The underlying video hardware
	  must implement the X RENDER extension. This should supported by all
	  modern video hardware.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Anti-aliased fonts get rendered by the Freetype library.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      &app; is free software, distributed under the terms of the
      <link linkend="COPYING">GPL, version 3</link>.
