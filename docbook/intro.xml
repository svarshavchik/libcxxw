      &appshort; is an optional add-on library to &libcxx; that
      implements an X widget toolkit with a modern C++ API.
      &appshort; aims to make it possible to implement a
      basic, no-frills X user interface in modern C++.
      This short demo gives a brief overview of &appshort;'s X widget
      toolkit implementation:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  An independent X widget toolkit stack, from the ground up. The
	  only dependencies are low-level
	  libraries that are not tied to any particular desktop environment.
	  See <xref linkend="INSTALL" /> for more information.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Combines a clean modern look with classical, traditional UI
	  widgets.
	  Mild gradient shading provides a subtle, non-intrusive
	  3D effect.
	  Traditional UI widgets include
	  labels, checkboxes, radio buttons, input fields,
	  lists, combo-boxes, menus, and dialogs &mdash; updated to modern
	  UI standards: <link linkend="passwordfields">confirming the last
	    character typed into a
	    password field</link> before masking it, predictive selection of
	  combo-box entries, <link linkend="spininput">spin buttons</link>
	  for numerical input fields, etc...
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Create widgets
	  <link linkend="uigenerator">from an <acronym>XML</acronym>
	    stylesheet</link> that supports the majority of the C++ library
	  API. Adjust the visual appearance of widgets simply by editing
	  the stylesheet, without recompiling the code.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  All widgets have full
	  keyboard navigation, where possible. No explicit application
	  support is needed. Even scroll-bars have keyboard controls.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Takes full advantage of modern C++17 language features. Lambdas
	  handle UI events (button clicks, menu selections, and other
	  activity). Variant types provide compact means for
	  selecting alternative options.
	  All widgets are reference-counted objects.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Fully scalable and themeable widgets use a
	  <link linkend="sxg">library-specific
	    scalable graphic format</link>, to fractionally scale the widgets
	  to a targeted size.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Unlike other widget toolkits,
	  &app; does not force the application to use an event-driven
	  design. &appshort; uses an internal execution thread to handle
	  &xproto; events. The application's UI remains responsive to X
	  events, while the main application runs a
	  long-running task (with all pointer and button activity suspended).
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  &appshort;'s build scripts allow running, <emphasis>and
	    developing with</emphasis> multiple versions of the library
	  concurrently. It's possible to install different &appshort; versions
	  for applications that use different <acronym>ABI</acronym>s, solving
	  this common problem with using large C++ libraries.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      &app; is free software, distributed under the terms of the
      <link linkend="COPYING">GPL, version 3</link>.

      <title>Status</title>

      <para>
	&app;'s core functionality is complete, and
	<link linkend="INSTALL">is available for downloading</link>.
	The most recent build of &app; adds an initial implementation of the
	<link linkend="uixmldoc"><command>cxxwcreator</command></link>
	tool,
	adds alpha channel support to the
	<link linkend="fontcolorpickers">color picker widget</link>,
	and optimizes window refreshes and redrawing.
